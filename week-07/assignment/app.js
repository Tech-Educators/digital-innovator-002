// With my CSS, I want to make sure my app is designed from a mobile first perspective, and also looks good on desktop.

// Decide on two Design Principles to use:
// 1:
// 2:
// and ALSO, write about them in my reflection

// Check all inputs have a label.

// Pick at least one accessibility consideration
// 1:
// and ALSO mention what I did in my reflection

// --- --- ---
// I need to make sure that I have created a form in my HTML
// I need to gert my javascript to select that form
// I need to add an event listener to my form, so that when it is submitted, it gets the user data and calls a fetch function
// NOTE TO SELF: remember to look for those two fancy lines of code which create a formData object for me.

// I need to make a function which makes a fetch request to the API I chose.
// Hmmmmmmmm, wasn't there something about async/await?.....
// We spent a lot of time on Query Strings. Maybe that's useful for my fetch() request

// Once I have made my fetch request, I should render those results on the page.
// Didn't Frankie use a loop for that? Something to test out.
